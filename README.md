### GODOT TIME
This is a starter project game. I've copied the starter code from [here](https://github.com/GDQuest/godot-getting-started-2021/releases/tag/0.3.0)

I'm followed this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEt2JHEe-do) to make this game but
the game originates from the [Godot documentation.](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)
